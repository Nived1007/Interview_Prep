1. What is PySpark, and how does it work?

PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, an open-source distributed computing system designed for big data processing and analytics. 
PySpark allows you to write Spark applications using Python, making it easier for Python developers to work with large datasets across a cluster of machines.

Apache Spark Core:

Spark is written in Scala and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

PySpark acts as a bridge between Python code and the Spark engine.

Python Driver Program:

You write Python code using PySpark.

This code creates a SparkContext or SparkSession to connect to a Spark cluster.

Communication via Py4J:

PySpark uses Py4J, a library that enables Python programs to dynamically access Java objects.

Your Python code communicates with the JVM-based Spark engine under the hood.

RDD and DataFrame APIs:

You can work with RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) for low-level operations or use DataFrames for higher-level SQL-like operations.

DataFrames are more optimized and easier to use.

Distributed Processing:

Spark splits your data and code into tasks and distributes them across worker nodes in a cluster.

Workers perform computations in parallel, boosting performance for large datasets.

Lazy Evaluation:

PySpark builds a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of transformations and only executes them when an action (like .collect(), .show(), .write()) is called.

âœ… Key Features:
Parallel computing: Handles massive data volumes.

Scalability: Works on a local machine or a massive cluster.

Built-in support for SQL, ML, Streaming, Graphs via libraries like:

pyspark.sql

pyspark.ml

pyspark.streaming

pyspark.graphframes

2. Explain the architecture of PySpark.

1. Driver Program (Python)
Where your PySpark code runs.

Contains the SparkSession or SparkContext.

Converts operations into a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).

Sends tasks to the cluster manager.

2. PySpark API (Python Layer)
Provides classes like DataFrame, RDD, SparkSession, etc.

Uses Py4J to translate Python commands into JVM calls.

3. Py4J Gateway
A communication bridge between the Python process and the JVM process.

Converts Python commands into Java bytecode calls and vice versa.

4. Spark Driver (JVM)
The actual master node.

Handles:

Task scheduling

Job coordination

Fault tolerance

5. Cluster Manager
Manages resources across the cluster.

Allocates Executors to the Driver.

Types:

Standalone

YARN

Mesos

Kubernetes

6. Executors (on Worker Nodes)
Run the tasks sent by the driver.

Perform transformations and actions.

Store data in memory or disk (for caching/persistence)
